/*
  This program modifies float-counts to 'float-stats'.  float-stats are
  identical to float-counts in terms of C++ data-structures, but conceptually
  they are a little different in that they represent n-gram stats in a different
  way, more explicitly.  These are useful in computing relative entropies
  between differently pruned LMs, and in the E-M procedure that we use to update
  LMs after pruning, when we want to make them as close as possible to the
  original (un-pruned) LM.

  As an example, suppose we have a 3-gram LM.  Firstly, note that the float-stats
  will always be structurally the same as the float-counts from which they
  were generated, i.e. they contain the same number of states and counts.  This
  is important in the entropy computation.

  Consider an order-3 state (history-length = 2).
  The counts in this history-state represent counts of a particular 3-gram in
  an amount of data generated from the LM that's equal to our original training
  data (after weighting by whatever source-specific weights we used), and with
  the same distribution of history-states as our training data.
  So for instance, a count for "a b c" represents the expected count of the
  sequence "a b c" in the corpus.  We don't have to add any backoff weights to
  this (that is what this program, float-counts-to-float-stats, is for).

  The backoff count for an order-3 state represents the sum-total (expected)
  count of all sequences of the form "a b X" that are not explicitly listed
  by counts of the form "a b c".

  Now consider an order-2 state, say the state for the history "b".
  The count for "b c" equals the total of all counts of the form "X b c"
  that were not accounted for by counts of the form "a b c".
  The count for "b *" equals the total of all counts of the form "b X"
  that were not accounted for by counts of the form "a b c" or "b c".

  Now consider the order-1 state.  The count for "c" equals the total of all
  counts of the form "X Y c" that were not accounted for by counts of the form
  "a b c" or "b c".

  Note that some of the stats may be double counted.  A highest-order
  count like "a b c" will never be counted elsewhere, but supposing
  there is no explicit bigram for "b c", then the total probability for all
  sequences "X b c" where there is no explicit count of the form "a b c",
  will be included in both the backoff-count for history-state "b "(because it
  matches the pattern "b *"), and also in the unigram count for
  word "c" (because it matches the pattern "* c").  However, if we exclude
  the backoff counts, the other stats are all disjoint, i.e. the
  trigram stats like "a b c", the bigram stats like "b c" and the unigram
  stats like "c", these are all disjoint and they should add up to the count
  of training data (after applying corpus weights).

  The output goes to several files, one for each n-gram order.  This is
  because if we were to output them all as one file, the history
  states would get out of order (the lower-order history states would
  get delayed).  It's most convenient to output to several files, and
  then merge those files using merge-float-counts.
